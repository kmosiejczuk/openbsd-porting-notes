Trying to transplant this onto graphics/pcl and possibly others that
use cmake and are failing complaining about things found in libstdc++fs

Looking at the work that thfr@ did to get graphics/glslang working
for sparc64.  It uses cmake and needs libstdc++fs for ports-gcc to
work.

(thfr uses SUBST_VARIABLES with ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES and patches one of
the instances of CMakeLists.txt)

Other ports of potential interest:

graphics/glslang
graphics/openexr
graphics/shaderc
graphics/spirv-tools
